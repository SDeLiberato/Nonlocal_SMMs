# Nonlocal Scattering Matrix Calculator
This module implements the nonlocal scattering matrix formalism available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) or behind a paywall. It allows you to calculate the reflectance of anisotropic planar semiconductor heterostructures. Documentation is available [here](.....). If you use the code please cite the paper!

# Installation
This repository is packaged using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Having installed Poetry you can install the package and it's dependancies as:

``` Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cgubbin/nonlocal_smms.git
$ cd nonlocal_smms
$ poetry install
```

Examples are demonstrated in Jupyter notebooks in `/examples`, to launch the notebook server run:

``` Bash
$ cd examples
$ poetry run jupyter notebook
```
